**Theme:** Resource control in the dark and abysmal after-future of Earth. Conquer and defend territories in three regions: the floating junk yards of space, the ruined colony of the Moon, and the destroyed homeland of Earth itself.

**Board:** Territories are each a hex tile a number on them, which is produced each turn. Tile types are space, moon, and earth. Resource types are Organics, Ore, Rare Metals, and Production, and are produced if the number on them is rolled. Any tile may be transformed into or back from an Energy Harvester for a nominal fee. Having an Energy Harvester means that no normal resources are gained from that territory any more. Instead, you gain a unit of Energy. Energy pays for upkeep costs, one unit per tile you own. If you cannot provide enough energy, you are operating below efficiency and you get 2 less of each resource.

**Combat:** On a given turn, the person whose turn it is declares attackers (primary + secondary) into each territory they wish to try to capture. Then the defenders can choose which of the adjacent territories will be secondary supports to each contested territory. Secondary units count for half their value in combat. After this step, all combats are resolved. A die is rolled for each unit, multiplied by half if they are a secondary unit, and then added to the total. The side whose total is highest wins the battle, and captures the territory. If the defense loses, the primary defender must retreat if possible, or be destroyed. After the combat, each player must pay the original build cost for each unit involved to avoid losing it.

**Phases:** Upkeep (check energy and collect resources), Development (research or energy harvester creation/destruction), Attacking/Move (move units and declare attackers), Combat (resolve combat), Retreats (all losing units must retreat or be destroyed), Fees (pay for all combat)
